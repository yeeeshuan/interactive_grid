# Project description: 
The purpose of this website is to educate designers on machine learning libraries and methods to design for accessible interactionsâ€”a keyboard is often hard to use for those with disabilities that affect mobility, and hardware designed for accessibility is often expensive and uncomfortable.

# Main Interactions: 
Using the panel on the right, users can activate a variety of interactions to move around and color the grid. 

Interactions for moving around the grid: 
- Keyboard (default): use the keyboard to move around the grid correspondingly 
- Face: move your face up, down, left, and right to move around the grid correspondingly 
- Sound: say left, right, up, down to move around the grid correspondingly

Interactions for coloring modules: 
- Keyboard (default): use keys 1, 2, and 3 to assign colors to the modules. Use the backspace bar to clear a module. 
- Hands: hold up 1, 2, or 3 fingers to assign colors to the modules. Hold up 4 fingers to clear a module. 
- Object: Hold up different objects to the camera to assign them to different colors. To assign/clear color to a grid, simply hold up the object to the - camera. 
- Sound: Clap, crinkle paper, or knock on the table to assign different colors to a module.
